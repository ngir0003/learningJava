# Java Syntax
Refers to set of rules that define how Java programs are written and interpreted by the compiler. These rules ensure that your code is readable, logically correct, and error-free.

```
public class Main{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

## Terminologies fo a Basic Java Program

 1. **Class Declaration:** Every Java program starts with a class declaration using the class keyword. "A class is a blueprint of an object" and we can also define class as a logical template that shares common properties and methods.

 2. **Object:** The object is an instance of a class. Its is an entity that has behavior and state.

 3. **Main Method** The public static void main(String args[]) method is the entry point where the program starts excution.

 4. **Statements:** Each line of code inside the method must end with a semicolon(;).

 # Java Comments
 Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

 ## Single-line Comments
 Single-line cooments start with two forward slashes(//).
 Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

## Java Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with ```/*``` and ends with ```*/```.
Any text between ```/*``` and ```*/``` will be ignored by Java.
